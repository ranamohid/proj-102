                        You can read our Terms of Service in German and in Spanish below.
                </span>
                <p class="f">Here’s an overview of our terms. You can read our complete legal information below, but these are a few of the most
                    important bits, in plain English.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>You still own all the pictures you order from us. You keep the copyright to all your images. We won’t sell them, share them, or use them for anything other than getting your tiles printed and delivered to you.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Mixtiles app. When you open our app for the first time, it’ll ask you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select, crop, and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later, or delete the app to remove the permission.</p></li>
                    <li><p>If you want, we’ll delete all your pictures and personal information from our systems. All you need to do is send us an email to hi@mixtiles.com from the email address you entered when you made your order.</p></li>
                    <li><p>You agree not to order any pictures you don’t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content. There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can’t print any images with nudity or offensive content. We also can’t print pictures you don’t own the copyright to.</p></li>
                    <li><p>If there’s a problem with your tiles, we’ll give you a refund or replace them for you. If there are any issues, just send us an email to hi@mixtiles.comor a chat through the app. We’ll get it all sorted out.</p></li>
                </ul>
